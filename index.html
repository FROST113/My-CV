              <h3 class="card-title">Biography</h3>
              <p class="card-text">My name is Juan Zwarts, I am from Pretoria South Africa and I am a professional Software Developer. When I graduated high school I did not yet know what I really wanted to do or be, I had had a passion for cooking and decided I want to become a chef. I studied professional cookery for two years at the Capital Hotel School and Training Academy in the heart of Pretoria. After my graduation I started working in the industry and had a combined three years work experience in the industry with my practicals and full employment. At a stage I wanted to experience something different, I decided to go back to collage and did a diploma in Business Principles and management. Soon after finishing the diploma I was introduced to the world of software and web development.</p>

              <p>With my interests peaked I started doing online courses through TreeHouse and Udemy to understand the fundamentals of web development. While I was busy with the courses I started to Inturn for a small software development company to learn the in's and out's of the Industry. Soon after I was employed full time to the company creating websites and working on bigger systems with the aid of my senior developers. I am always looking to improve myself and learn as much as I can to become a Full Stack Developer. I am currently busy with my Full Stack Web & Software Engineer course through Hyperion Dev.</p>

              <p>Being a Software Developer aids me in fulfilling my life's passion to create. I also enjoy the aspect of problem-solving this industry provides. My motivations are to become better, learn more, and be outstanding in my field of work. I truly enjoy and find both the Front-End and Back-End aspects of Software Development Extremely Interesting and would enjoy becoming a full-fledged Full Stack Developer.</p>
